# Project Guideline
## What?
This is a list of guidelines to consider following for Zinc projects. It was initially created using thoughts/ideas from our Notabli Retrospective, but ideally will become a living document, contributed to over time.
## Recommendations
* Agree on project priorities at the start.
    * Examples: The goal of Project A is to become profitable. The goal of Project B is to learn about SEO.
* Develop one workflow for the project for everyone to stick to.
* Stick to either small steps with easier hand-offs or large steps with fewer hand-offs.
* Name one person as the official project manager.
* Have regular check-ins involving all stakeholders. (e.g. clients too if applicable)
