        intellectual property while also maintaining flexibility for the Cooperative to determine the best means to
        commercialize any intellectual property. Therefore, for each Worker-Owned Technology Project, the Cooperative
        shall maintain a record of each Member’s patronage for each Worker-Owned Technology Project separately. We will
        keep written records of the date on which a product's development began and all Members and the Cooperative will
        track their work hours on each product. If certain work cannot be adequately pegged to a specific product, then
        the EAC, in consultation with the Members involved in the Worker-Owned Technology Project, will make reasonable
        estimates of time allocations across products and document the basis for the allocations.</p>
