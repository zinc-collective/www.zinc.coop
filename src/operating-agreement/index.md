f. When ballots are distributed at a meeting, the number of Members voting shall be considered present for the purposes of determining quorum with respect to the specific actions in the ballot.

### 5. Member Unable to Attend Meeting

If a Member is unable to attend a meeting, then that Member must notify the other Members twenty-four (24) hours prior to the commencement of the meeting. If the Member is unable to participate in the meeting in any form, then that Member shall be responsible for reading the minutes and notes taken from that meeting.

The EAC shall keep a record of the proposal and outcome of the vote. If fewer than 60% of the Members agree that a decision is needed quickly, then the Proposal shall be made at the next Member Meeting and shall be brought and considered in the manner in which Proposals are required to be brought.

### 9. Quorum

The minimum number of Members needed to be at a meeting to make decisions binding is referred to as “quorum.” The Cooperative intends for its Members to initiate and lead projects for the Cooperative. It has therefore adopted a decision-making structure where most decisions can be made at a meeting with a smaller quorum while major decisions require a higher quorum.

#### a. Default Provisions

Unless designated a Major Decision (as defined below), all proposals of the Cooperative may be considered and decided at a meeting with quorum of fifty percent (50%) of the Membership in attendance.

### 11. Unanimous Consent Required

#### a. Amend this Operating Agreement

The unanimous consent of the Members is required to amend this Operating Agreement.

#### b. Acts outside of the Ordinary Course of the Cooperative’s Activities

Pursuant to Section 17704.07(c)(4) of RULLCA (the California law governing LLCs), the unanimous approval of the Members is required to take any activities outside the ordinary course of the Cooperative’s activities, except as otherwise provided under Article 10 of RULLCA.

### 12. Committees and Delegation

The Members may delegate the management of certain tasks and realms to committees, and those committees shall meet separately from the Management Meetings.

### 13. Adopting Other Rules and Policies

The Members may adopt other rules and policies outside of this Agreement. The Members shall record all other rules and policies in a separate document that is provided to all Members, or they shall amend this Agreement to include the new rules and policies.

## E. Cooperative Projects

### 1. Two Types of Cooperative Projects

The Cooperative will engage in two distinct types of projects and will record patronage for separately for each type, as follows:

#### a. Direct Client Service Projects.

i. Description: These projects shall typically be paid by a third-party client in exchange for services from the Cooperative and its agents. Direct Client Service Projects will typically have a defined scope, timeline, and negotiated rates with the third-party client. Contracts for Direct Client Service Projects shall typically be between the third-party client and the Cooperative.

ii. Consolidated Patronage Record: The Cooperative shall maintain a consolidated record of all patronage by Members in support of all Direct Client Service Projects.

#### b. Worker-Owned Technology Projects.

i. Description. Members of the Cooperative may choose to develop software programs, applications, or other intellectual property for the purpose of commercialization, including but not limited to use in future Direct Client Service Projects. The Cooperative anticipates that Worker-Owned Technology Projects shall have a longer timeline for commercialization.

ii. Distinct and Separate Patronage Records. The Cooperative seeks to simultaneously compensate those Members who contribute to the research and development of intellectual property while also maintaining flexibility for the Cooperative to determine the best means to commercialize any intellectual property. Therefore, for each Worker-Owned Technology Project, the Cooperative shall maintain a record of each Member’s patronage for each Worker-Owned Technology Project separately. We will keep written records of the date on which a product's development began and all Members and the Cooperative will track their work hours on each product. If certain work cannot be adequately pegged to a specific product, then the EAC, in consultation with the Members involved in the Worker-Owned Technology Project, will make reasonable estimates of time allocations across products and document the basis for the allocations.

## F. How Money is Managed in the Cooperative

### 1. Capital Accounts.

a. Each Member will have an internal account called the “Capital Account,” which generally represents an accounting of the Member’s contributions to and distributions from the Cooperative and the Member’s share of the Cooperative’s net profits and net losses. In particular, a Member’s Capital Account includes the total of the Member’s Capital Contributions in cash and the fair market value of any property contributed to the Cooperative (net of any liabilities that the Cooperative assumes) plus the Member’s share of Cooperative net profits, minus the amount of cash or the fair market value of any property 8 (net of any liabilities that the Member assumes) distributed to the Member from the Cooperative and minus the Member’s share of the Cooperative’s net losses.

b. The Cooperative will maintain a separate Capital Account for each Member in accordance with the capital account rules of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations, and this Operating Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations. For this purpose, the Cooperative may, upon the occurrence of the events specified in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), increase or decrease the Capital Accounts in accordance with the rules of such regulation and Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) to reflect a revaluation of Cooperative property.

c. For purposes of this Agreement, “net profit” or “net loss” means the Cooperative’s taxable income or loss for federal income tax purposes for the applicable period, as reasonably adjusted by the EAC in consultation with a qualified accountant or bookkeeper.

### 2. Taxes.

a. It is intended that the Cooperative be treated as a partnership for federal, state, and local income tax purposes.

b. The Members shall, individually, be responsible for paying federal, state, and any local income taxes attributable to their share of the Cooperative’s net profits and losses, whether or not cash distributions are made by the Cooperative to the Members.

c. Members understand that all Cooperative income must be allocated to the Members’ Capital Accounts, and acknowledge that they will need to pay taxes on the share of Cooperative income that is allocated to their Capital Accounts, including income that has not been distributed to Members. In addition, Members are responsible for paying all other taxes imposed on them individually, including quarterly self-employment taxes, as applicable.

### 3. Fiscal Year.

The fiscal year of the Cooperative for accounting and tax purposes shall begin on January 1 and end on December 31, except for any shorter taxable years in the years of the Cooperative’s formation and termination.

### 4. Allocation of Profits.

The net profits of the Cooperative shall be allocated among the Members based on i) the type of Project; and ii) the Member’s respective patronage for each project type, as follows:

#### a. Direct Client Service Projects

Profits attributable to all Direct Client Service Projects shall be allocated to the Member’s based on the consolidated patronage account maintained in connection with these projects under Section E.1.a.ii above.

#### b. Worker-Owned Technology Projects

The Members agree and acknowledge that profits are not anticipated on Worker-Owned Technology projects until the intellectual property can be successfully sold or licensed. When such profits are realized, they shall be divided among all past and present worker-owners on the basis of the total number of hours each worker- owner put into the product's development and marketing since the beginning of product development, consistent with the patronage records maintained for each project under Section E.1.b.ii.

### 5. Retaining Earnings and Making Distributions.

Distributions are cash or other assets paid to Members from their Capital Accounts. On a quarterly basis, 30% of the Cooperative’s projected net profits attributable to the quarter in question, as reasonably determined by the EAC in consultation with a qualified accountant or bookkeeper, shall be distributed to the Members in the same manner that such net profits would be allocated to the Members pursuant to Section F.4. The Cooperative shall not make distributions to the Members if doing so would leave the Cooperative unable to pay its obligations and liabilities. A Member shall not be entitled to withdraw any part of the Member’s Capital Contribution or to receive any distributions, whether of money or property, from the Cooperative except as specifically provided in this Operating Agreement.

### 6. Sharing Losses.

If the Cooperative has net losses, Members will share those net losses in proportion to their Capital Accounts.

### 7. Additional Tax Matters.

Except as otherwise provided in this Operating Agreement, all items of Cooperative income, gain, loss, deduction and any other allocations not otherwise provided for shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as net profits and net losses under Section F.4 and Section F.6, as the case may be. To the extent a Member shall have a negative Capital Account balance, there shall be a qualified income offset, as set forth in Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Treasury Regulations. Each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Cooperative for federal, state and local income tax purposes will be allocated among the Members in the same manner as such income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated among the Members’ Capital Accounts. Items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Cooperative with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Cooperative shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), using any method allowed by Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder selected by the EAC. The Members shall make appropriate amendments to the allocations of items pursuant to this Section if necessary in order to comply with Section 704 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

### 8. Tax Return Information.

Within 90 days after the end of each taxable year, the Cooperative shall send to each Member:

a. the information necessary to complete federal and state income tax or information returns; and

b. a copy of the Cooperative’s federal, state, and local income tax or information returns for the year, if available, and if not as soon as it is available.

### 9. Tax Administration.

a. The Members and the Cooperative acknowledge that the Cooperative is currently qualified under Section 6221(b) of the Code to elect out of the centralized partnership audit regime rules of Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code, and hereby agree that the Cooperative shall make such election for all applicable tax years, in accordance with Section 6221(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations for so long as it qualifies.

b. In the event the Cooperative is required to appoint a “Partnership Representative” within the meaning of Section 6223 of the Code (and any comparable provision of state or local law, including as “tax matters partner”) with respect to a tax year of the Cooperative, the Chair or the Treasurer of the EAC shall be the “Partnership Representative.”

c. If applicable, the Partnership Representative:

i. is authorized and required to represent the Cooperative (at the Cooperative’s expense) in connection with all income tax examinations of the Cooperative’s affairs by tax authorities; and

ii. agrees not to settle or otherwise resolve any such examination in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the Members without the prior written consent of any such affected Members.

d. If applicable, each Member agrees to cooperate with the Partnership Representative and the Cooperative with respect to the conduct of such examinations.

## G. Record Keeping and Accounting

c. Where a Vote of Confidence regarding a Violating Member has failed, the membership of such Member shall be terminated.

d. Upon notice of a violation that would trigger a Vote of Confidence, the EAC shall give notice to the Members of the reason(s) for the Vote of Confidence and no less than fourteen (14) days for the Members to submit their votes.

If funds are available and, with approval by at least 75% of the Members, the Cooperative may elect to pay the Member within 30 days of when she leaves. There shall be no fee or penalty for prepayment of such loan by the Cooperative. d. Designated Beneficiary in case of Death. If a Member passes away, the payment will go to the Member’s Designated Beneficiary(ies), whose name appears in the Statement of Information of that Member.
