We currently have a monthly members-only meeting. We will publish meeting summaries here.

## Member meeting - April 17, 2020

*   Reviewed [Zinc's Q1 2020 finances](/financial-overview/#2020-q1) in preperation to publish them.
*   Reviewed incoming leads for project or client work. Decided to pursue three client partnerships.
*   Reviewed existing projects. Decided to clearly express our needs from an existing client to decide whether the relationship has long-term viability. Decided to ramp up efforts on modernizing Moment Park.
*   Discussed amending operating agreement to reduce unilateral spending decisions. General agreement with a formal proposal to be voted on via email.
*   Discussed continuing the "no one merges their own patches" experiment. Chose to revise to "maintainers may merge their own patches with a previous review approval so long as additional changes were to address previous approvals feedback."
*   Discussed pace of incoming contributors. Agree that we want to "keep our door open" but that we don't want to spend time and energy chasing potential contributors.
*   Discussed and agreed to explore migrating off of ConvertKit and Calendly in favor of [Support](https://github.com/zinc-collective/support) to dog-food a sustainable, customer-and-worker owned alternative to existing customer development software.

*   Agreed to move [Compensated's landing page](https://www.zinc.coop/compensated/) to the [Zinc website](https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/)

*   Discussed how to compensate potential members for their contributions.
    *   Agreed that at least currently, we are not in a position to compensate well with cash.
    *   If the potential members do end up joining the collective, we could count their work in lieu of some or all of the required capital contribution to join.
