            Discussed how to compensate potential members for their contributions.
            <ul>
              <li>Agreed that at least currently, we are not in a position to compensate well with cash.</li>
              <li>If the potential members do end up joining the collective, we could count their work in lieu of some or all of the required capital contribution to join.</li>
              <li>We will discuss how to compensate on an individual level for now.</li>
