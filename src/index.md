# The Zinc Collective

🤗 We are an open-source volunteer coding group of diverse individuals. 

🗓️ We meet weekly to work on coding projects.

We strive for a post-scarcity society by:

*   Creating and capturing value with human-centered, sustainable digital products and services.
*   Redistributing that wealth in a way that rectifies socioeconomic power imbalances.
*   Taking responsibility for and reducing the social and ecological costs of our digital products and services.
